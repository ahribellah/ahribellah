Hi, I'm Ari. I am a programmer, musician, and retro computing enthusiast. My pronouns are **they/them**.

I am currently working on:

* A music livecoding system in Rust and [Mech](http://mech-lang.org/).
* [Ports](https://games.ahribellah.space/retro/) of several retro games to modern systems.

I am always eager to discuss music, music software, retro computers, retro gaming, software preservation, and programming language design.

You can find a list of my projects [here](http://ahribellah.space). My email is in my profile.
