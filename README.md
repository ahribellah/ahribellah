Hi, I'm Ari. I am a musician and retro computing enthusiast. My pronouns are **they/them**.

I am currently working on a music livecoding system in Rust and [Mech](http://mech-lang.org/), as well as various utilities to help with the emulation of retro operating systems.

I am always eager to discuss music, music software, retro computers, and programming language design.

You can find a list of my projects [here](http://ahribellah.space). My email is in my profile.
