Hi, I'm Ari. I'm a programmer, musician, and retro computing enthusiast.

My pronouns are **they/them**.

My (programming) interests include:

- Audio engineering
- Creative coding
- Game development
- Retro computing
- Programming language design

You can find a list of my projects [here](https://ahribellah.space/).

I am currently in the process of moving all of my coding projects to [a self-hosted Forgejo instance](https://garden.folkofthefo.rest/ahribellah). This GitHub profile will serve exclusively to interact with projects that are hosted here and will not host or mirror any of my projects going forward.
