Hi, I'm Ari. I am a programmer, game developer, musician, and retro computing enthusiast.

My pronouns are **they/them**.

I am currently working on:

* A creative coding framework.
* An unnamed multiplayer interactive experience.
* A port of The Adventures of El Ballo to the Godot engine.

I am always eager to discuss music, music software, retro computers, retro gaming, software preservation, and programming language design.

You can find a list of all of my projects [here](https://ahribellah.space). My email is in my profile.
