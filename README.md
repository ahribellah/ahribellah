Hi, I'm Ari. I am a programmer, game developer, musician, and retro computing enthusiast.

My pronouns are **they/them**.

I am currently working on:

* An unnamed multiplayer interactive experience.
* [Ports](https://ahribellah.space/games/retro) of several games to modern systems.

I am always eager to discuss music, music software, retro computers, retro gaming, software preservation, and programming language design.

You can find a list of all of my projects [here](https://ahribellah.space). You can also follow me on <a rel="me" href="https://tech.lgbt/@atilde">Mastodon</a>. My email is in my profile.
